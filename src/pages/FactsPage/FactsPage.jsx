        <h2>It wasn’t always called coffee</h2>
        <p>When coffee was first discovered, it wasn’t called coffee but ‘Qahhwat al-bun,’ which, when translated from Arabic, means ‘the wine of the bean.’
        Over time, it was shortened to ‘Qhawa,’ and then the Turks later changed to ‘Kahve.’
        It didn’t stop there as it became popular in the Dutch language as “koffie,” which is where its English equivalent was borrowed.
        Coffee found its way into the English dictionary sometime in the 16th century.

        <h2>Coffee beans come from a fruit</h2>
        <p>
        Although they’ve always been called beans, they are seeds that come from a cherry-like berry that grows on a bush. At the center of the fruit is the pit, which is what we roast to make coffee. 
        They are called seeds because of their striking resemblance with legumes. So the next time someone tells you to eat fruits, tell them that you’ve just had one.
