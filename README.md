> Cold&Brew a is blog where you can create and save recipes and methods for preparing a great cup of coffee, also you can create reviews about coffee that you have tried. In this project I used ReactJs to apply the aquaried knowledge in my last module of my bootcamp and together with what I also learned in my first two modules, I created this full stack application. One of my biggest challenges I faced was how to link the frontend routes with the backend, and how to implement the Google Maps API beacuse a lot of libraries that I tried seems that are outdated, but finally I found one that works with ReactJs.
